## Background

Factor is short for influencing factor, or simply understood as index. We all know that stock returns are affected by multiple factors, such as macro, industry, liquidity, company fundamentals, trading sentiment, and so on. The so-called "multi-factor model" is simply to find those factors that are most relevant to stock returns, and use these factors (factors or indicators) to describe stock returns and select stocks.

Multi-factor model is one of the most widely used and most mature quantitative stock selection models in the field of quantitative investment. It is based on modern financial investment theories such as portfolio, capital asset pricing (CAPM) and arbitrage pricing theory (APT). The multi-factor model assumes that the market is inefficient or weakly efficient and obtains excess returns through active portfolio management. The core idea of multi-factor stock selection is that market forces are multiple and dynamic, but there are always factors that are stable over time. In the practice of quantification, different multi-factor models are constructed because different market participants or analysts have different understandings of market dynamics and factors.



## Exploratory data analysis

The following packages will be used in this project:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(quantmod)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(farver)
library(dplyr)
```

### Data description

The original two datasets are downloaded from CSMAR (http://www.gtarsc.com).

#### Data 1: Stocks and factors
```{r}
setwd('/Users/liuxiaoyu/Desktop/RUC/Advanced_applied_statistics/project/Fac')
Fac <- read.table('Fivefac.csv',sep="\t",header=T,fileEncoding="UCS-2LE",stringsAsFactors = F)
head(Fac)
```

Let us have a quick look at our data, especially the variables:
```{r}
str(Fac)
```

Then we extract certain part of the original dataset, that is a specific type of stock P9709 and five factors renamed as 'Trddt','MAR','SMB','HML', 'RMW' and 'CMA'.

```{r}
Fac <- Fac[Fac$MarkettypeID == 'P9709'& Fac$Portfolios == 1,c(2,4,6,8,10,12)]
Fac$TradingDate <- as.Date(Fac$TradingDate)
colnames(Fac) <- c('Trddt','MAR','SMB','HML','RMW','CMA')
head(Fac)
```

#### Data 2: Stocks and Returns

```{r}
setwd('/Users/liuxiaoyu/Desktop/RUC/Advanced_applied_statistics/project/Fac')
stk <- read.table('SSE50.csv',sep="\t",header=T,fileEncoding="UCS-2LE",stringsAsFactors = F)
stk$Stkcd <- as.character(stk$Stkcd)
stk$Trddt <- as.Date(stk$Trddt)
head(stk)
```
For the convenience of analysis, we transpose the data into the following format, with all stocks as columns.
```{r}
stkCls <- dcast(stk,Trddt~Stkcd,value.var = 'Clsprc')
stkCls[1:5,1:5]
```
The following picture demonstrates four stocks, including 600000, 600016, 600019 and 600028, and their closing prices. 
```{r}
da <- stkCls[,1]
title <- 'Closing Price'
p1<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkCls[,2],type=rep('600000',length(da)))
p2<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkCls[,3],type=rep('600016',length(da)))
p3<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkCls[,4],type=rep('600019',length(da)))
p4<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkCls[,5],type=rep('600028',length(da)))
pdata<-rbind(p1,p2,p3,p4)
ggplot(pdata,aes(x=date, y=ma,color=type))+
    theme(legend.position=c(0.9,0.75))+geom_line(size=0.6)+ylab('Closing Price')+
    ggtitle(title)+
    theme(plot.title=element_text(size=14,hjust=0.5,colour='black',face='bold'))
```
The picture tells us that among the four stocks, it is 600000 whose price changes most dramatically. Next we turn to compute and analyze the returns, which is of our interest, rather than the closing price itself.
```{r}
names <- colnames(stkCls)
myfun <- function(x){x <- c(NA,diff(log(x)))}
stkRet <- as.data.frame(apply(stkCls[2:ncol(stkCls)],2,myfun))
stkRet <- cbind(stkCls[,1],stkRet)
colnames(stkRet) <- names 
stkRet$Trddt <- as.Date(stkRet$Trddt)
stkRet[1:5,1:5]
```
Also, we present the log returns for the same four stocks.
```{r}
da <- stkRet[-1,1]
title <- 'log Returns'
r1<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkRet[-1,2],type=rep('600000',length(da)))
r2<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkRet[-1,3],type=rep('600016',length(da)))
r3<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkRet[-1,4],type=rep('600019',length(da)))
r4<-data.frame(date=da,ma=stkRet[-1,5],type=rep('600028',length(da)))
rdata<-rbind(r1,r2,r3,r4)
ggplot(rdata,aes(x=date, y=ma,color=type))+
    theme(legend.position=c(0.9,0.25))+geom_line(size=0.5)+ylab('log Returns')+
    ggtitle(title)+
    theme(plot.title=element_text(size=14,hjust=0.5,colour='black',face='bold'))
```

### Merge Data 1 and 2
```{r}
Fac <- Fac[Fac$Trddt %in% stkRet$Trddt,]
dt <- merge(Fac,stkRet)
dt[1:5,1:12]
```

Take the stock 600000 as an example, we now present the intuitive correlation of returns and five factors.

```{r}
qq <- quantile(dt$`600000`, seq(0, 1, 0.2), na.rm = TRUE)
qq
mutate(dt, return.quint = cut(`600000`, qq)) %>% 
  group_by(return.quint) %>% 
  summarize(f1 = mean(MAR, na.rm = TRUE), 
            f2 = mean(SMB, na.rm = TRUE), 
            f3 = mean(HML, na.rm = TRUE),
            f4 = mean(RMW, na.rm = TRUE),
            f5 = mean(CMA, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

## Goal of the Project

Apply the multi-factor model and choose a portfolio of five stocks.

* Algorithm

    **Step1**: The Fama-Frentch five-factor model was used to regression the return series of 50 stocks in Shanghai in the first 100 trading days to obtain the corresponding $\alpha$ of each stock. More precisely,
$$R_t = \alpha + m\cdot MAR_t + s\cdot SMB_t + h\cdot HML_t + r\cdot RMW_t + c\cdot CMA_t +e_t$$

    **Step 2**: Rank the alpha of each stock, taking the top five stocks with alpha largest.

    **Step 3**: Equal-weighted allocation of 5 stocks acquired and held for 30 trading days.
    
    **Step 4**: Portfolio reallocation every 30 days.
    
    **Step 5**: Return to Step 1.



* Model structure
